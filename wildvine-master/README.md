# 🌱 Wildvine – A Charity Website That Cares

Wildvine is more than just a bunch of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files rather a digital home for kindness.  
Built with simplicity and empathy in mind, this responsive website is designed to support causes that matter.

To explore the blend of **design and purpose**.  
Wildvine gave me the space to practice clean front-end development while imagining how tech can serve real-world impact.
